                        National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement is located in Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan,
                        Hubei Province, China. Approved by State Planning Commission, the Laboratory was officially established
                        in 1992, with co-funding by the Ministry of Agriculture. The Laboratory consists of three divisions:
                        Germplasm Enhancement and Breeding Theory, Cell Engineering, and Molecular Biology. Currently, it has
                        a staff of 66 members, including 61 researchers from two Colleges of the University, 3 technicians and
                        2 administrators, and provides spaces and training for over 800 graduate students toward both Master
                        and Ph D degrees in biology and crop science. The current director is Professor Zhang Qifa, and the Chairman
                        of the Academy Committee is Professor Fu Tingdong.

                        The overall goals of the Laboratory are to solve fundamental scientific problems in genetics, physiologic,
                        and crop improvement by combining biotechnology with conventional genetic analysis and breeding, to develop
                        new strategies and critical technologies for breeding applications, and to breed novel germplasms and
                        new varieties. The research activities cover a number of major crops including rice, rapeseed, cotton
                        and maize, at molecular, cellular, individual and population levels. The research areas of the Laboratory
                        include: (1) Functional genomics（functional genomic research platform, gene cloning, and functional genomics
                        of agricultural importance; (2) Biological mechanisms and utilization of heterosis; (3) Germplasm evaluation
                        and enhancement; (4) Breeding technology and varietal development; and (5) Physiological basis of genetic
                        improvement. The major target traits include yield, product quality, insect and disease resistance, drought
                        resistance and nutrition efficiency.

                        Progresses made in the past years have received international recognition in a number of research fields
                        including: (1) Discovery of Pol cytoplasm male sterility in B. napus that has been widely used in hybrid
                        breeding programs of B. napus and Cruciferae vegetables in the world; (2) Establishment of perfect technological
                        platforms for rice functional genomic studies including T-DNA insertional mutant libraries, cDNA microarray,
                        full-length cDNAs and related bioinformatic platforms; (3) Genetic and molecular basis of heterosis in
                        rice and rapeseed; (4) Cloning and functional characterization of genes for agronomically important traits
                        toward the goals of GSR(Green Super Rice) development; (5) Somatic hybridization between upland cotton
                        and wild cotton; (6) Development of crop varieties by combining conventional breeding with molecular
                        marker and transgenic technologies and widely application of the varieties for commercial production
                        (for example, oil-seed rape hybrids have been planted in a total planting area of more than 1 million
                        hectares annually).

                        The Laboratory was rated “excellent” in the past four consecutive nationwide evaluations (in year 1996, 2001,
                        2006, 2011 respectively) organized by the National Natural Science Foundation of China.
